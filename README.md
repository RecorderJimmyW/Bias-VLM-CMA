# Bias-in-Multimodal-model
In Table 1, the value of BiasVL for PASCAL-S should be 0.763, but was mistakenly written as 1.369. This was a typographical error and did not affect the methodology or conclusions. We have corrected this typo and updated the paper accordingly.
We updated the paper. We fixed minor typos, revised the references, and updated some citations from their preprint versions to the corresponding published conference versions. The updated version can be found in updated_version.pdf and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PDQZk4ahaGZN15-TPk9xNDD_Tt_HAkXY/view?usp=sharing).
